### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


For as long as I can remember, I have had a love for the intricate and the complex. I am perpetually curious and once hooked on an interesting topic, I will ask questions and hunt for answers until I am satisfied with the depth of my understanding. In college, my main focus was on Chemistry and Physics, which I majored and minored in respectively. My favorite projects involved searching for exoplanets with the KELT-Follow Up Network and the extremely detailed and sensitive work of creating standards in an analytical chemistry laboratory.

Following an intensive full-time program at App Academy, I have gained the skills of a qualified full stack software engineer with portfolio projects using React, Redux, Flask, and PostgreSQL. This experience has given me a unique lens through which to see not just applications and websites I use on a daily basis, but life itself. I enjoy theorizing about the behind-the-scenes code in my favorite video games, as well as the instruments I used in chemistry laboratories. With a developing interest in biotechnology, and a desire to apply both my extensive theoretical and practical knowledge in chemistry and physics, I am seeking intriguing opportunities to work on complex logic as a fullstack, front end, or back end engineer.
